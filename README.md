# my-personal-website

curious, creative, Adaptive

Wanted to create a simple/minimal website with interactive features.

-The home page/index has a photo that zooms in and out on hover.
    (At first I wanted to have a magnifying effect where the curser can magnify different parts of the photo when moved)
-The about me page has a few images with circle borders and a carousel. 
    (Unsure whether the page will look cleaner if I used a grid. Also I would like to expand this page more to had a scrool
    feature where images appear when scrolling.)
    (My carousel javascript did not work in the external file so I had to imbed it in the html, in general when i try more complicated javascript they tend to fail for some reason, while my alerts and console.log runs fine.)
-Portfolio is TBD
    (might include a sample image of the project, and have the image be the link or a button. Also with a discrition of the         project. Will most likely be a grid or table. 

Blocker and Sucesses
* I came to understand how the 'rem' measurment works while building the website.
* I also finally found how to change the font style!
* I am still struggling with how to effectivly use my margins/padding/etc (the concept is still iffy). Would alos like to better understand how they are effected between browsers and devices.
* hover is my new favorite css feature
